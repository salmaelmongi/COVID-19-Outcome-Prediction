# COVID-19-Outcome-Prediction


## overview:


This project aims to predict the recovery outcomes of individuals with coronavirus symptoms using machine learning classifiers. The dataset, based on World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, includes daily-level information on affected cases, deaths, and recoveries from the 2019 novel coronavirus.


## Key Components:

Classifiers: The project employs various classifiers, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines, to predict whether a person will recover or not upon admission to the hospital.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimal hyperparameters for each classifier are determined through grid search and cross-validation.

Evaluation Metrics: Performance is assessed using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC/AUC curves.
